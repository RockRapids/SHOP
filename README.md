## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the development strategy for a suite of eight interconnected web applications designed to serve the Rock Rapids, Iowa community. Rather than building a single monolithic platform, this project takes a modular approach with distinct yet complementary applications, each addressing a specific aspect of community life (in order of currently expected development): 

1) Centralized info and top level links to other apps [(.INFO)](https://rockrapids.github.io/FOSS/0/),

2) Volunteering and optimization/recognition of volunteer abilities/time [(.XYZ)](https://rockrapids.github.io/FOSS/7/),    

3) Retail promotions and shopping events [(.SHOP)](https://rockrapids.github.io/FOSS/4/),

4) Fun things to do, recreation and entertainment [(.FUN)](https://rockrapids.github.io/FOSS/2/),

5) Arts, music, gardening, collections, BBQ, writing and various forms of creativity [(.ART)](https://rockrapids.github.io/FOSS/1/),

6) Marketplace listings of top ten things on sale [(.STORE)](https://rockrapids.github.io/FOSS/5/) 

7) Local employment, remote/hybric employement, side-hustles [(.WORK)](https://rockrapids.github.io/FOSS/6/)

8) Civic, schoool, church, service provider information [(.GUIDE)](https://rockrapids.github.io/FOSS/3/)

The core strategy is to develop these applications in a phased approach, beginning with rockrapids.INFO as the central hub and primary navigation point for the entire ecosystem. Each application will be developed with a clear focus on addressing specific community needs while maintaining a coherent user experience across the entire suite.

This document outlines an alternative technical approach for the Rock Rapids community apps ecosystem, utilizing Next.js as the primary framework instead of WordPress. [Both were given significant consideration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hzM7osSUDd4wp0B3yXzxayoXBFc0UhhdF72XSqBHrLE/edit?usp=sharing), but the more modern architecture leverages the robust capabilities of Next.js, a React-based framework that offers both static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR), making it ideal for a content-focused community platform. The approach maintains the modular philosophy of eight interconnected applications (.INFO, .ART, .FUN, .GUIDE, .SHOP, .STORE, .XYZ, and .WORK) while providing a more unified technical foundation and improved performance characteristics.

## Key Technical Components

### Core Framework: Next.js

Next.js will serve as the foundation for all eight Rock Rapids applications, offering several advantages over the WordPress approach:

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pages are pre-rendered at build time, providing extremely fast load times and improved SEO
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Dynamic content can be rendered server-side when needed, combining performance with fresh content
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Pages can be regenerated in the background without rebuilding the entire site
- **API Routes**: Built-in API functionality for data operations without requiring a separate backend
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization for improved performance across devices
- **React Ecosystem**: Access to the entire React component ecosystem for rich interactivity
- **TypeScript Support**: Built-in TypeScript support for improved code quality and maintainability

### Headless CMS: Sanity.io

Rather than WordPress, Sanity.io will be used as the headless CMS, offering:

- **Structured Content**: Highly customizable content schemas specific to each Rock Rapids app
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple editors can work simultaneously without conflicts
- **Content API**: GraphQL and REST APIs for flexible content delivery
- **Portable Content**: Content is stored as structured data that can be easily migrated if needed
- **Custom Validation**: Define rules for content creation to maintain quality and consistency
- **Media Management**: Asset handling with automatic transformations and CDN delivery
- **Role-based Permissions**: Granular access controls for different community contributors

### Event Management: Integration with Eventbrite and TEC

For event management and publication, a dual integration approach will be implemented:

1. **Primary: Eventbrite API Integration**

   Eventbrite offers a comprehensive API that will be integrated directly with the Next.js applications:
   - **Events Discovery**: Access to public events in Rock Rapids through the Eventbrite API
   - **Event Creation**: Ability to create events through the API using organizer credentials
   - **Attendee Management**: Access to attendee lists and communication tools
   - **Ticket Sales**: Integration with Eventbrite's payment processing for ticketed events
   - **Check-in Tools**: Mobile-friendly check-in experiences for event organizers

2. **Alternative: The Events Calendar (TEC) Integration**

   As a secondary option or for organizations without Eventbrite, integration with The Events Calendar:
   - **Self-hosted Calendar**: Events can be managed through a dedicated TEC installation
   - **iCalendar Feed**: Events from TEC can be exported to the Rock Rapids platforms via iCal
   - **Two-way Synchronization**: Events created in either system can be mirrored across platforms
   - **Free Event Focus**: Ideal for community gatherings without ticketing requirements

### Database: Supabase

Supabase will serve as the backend database and authentication system:

- **PostgreSQL Database**: Powerful, open-source relational database
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Live database updates for dynamic content
- **Authentication System**: Built-in user management with multiple sign-in methods
- **Storage**: File storage for user-generated content
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless function execution for backend logic
- **Row-level Security**: Granular data access control for enhanced security

### Deployment and Hosting: Vercel

Vercel will provide hosting for the Next.js applications:

- **Global CDN**: Content delivery from edge locations worldwide
- **Automatic HTTPS**: Secure connections by default
- **Preview Deployments**: Automatic previews for new features before release
- **Analytics**: Built-in performance and usage analytics
- **Serverless Functions**: Backend logic without managing servers
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated deployment from GitHub repositories

## Application Architecture Design

### Monorepo Structure

The Rock Rapids community apps will be organized in a monorepo structure using Turborepo:

```
rockrapids/
├── apps/
│   ├── info/         # rockrapids.info application
│   ├── art/          # rockrapids.art application
│   ├── fun/          # rockrapids.fun application
│   ├── guide/        # rockrapids.guide application
│   ├── shop/         # rockrapids.shop application
│   ├── store/        # rockrapids.store application
│   ├── xyz/          # rockrapids.xyz application
│   └── work/         # rockrapids.work application
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/           # Shared UI components
│   ├── database/     # Database schemas and clients
│   ├── eventbrite/   # Eventbrite API integration
│   ├── tec/          # The Events Calendar integration

   - Community content creators add content through Sanity Studio

2. **Data Synchronization**
   - Scheduled jobs fetch new events from Eventbrite API
   - TEC events are synchronized via iCalendar or REST API
   - Content updates in Sanity trigger webhooks

3. **Content Processing**
   - Events are processed and normalized into a consistent format
   - Related content is linked (e.g., venues, organizations)
   - SEO metadata is generated

4. **Content Delivery**
   - Next.js pre-renders static pages during build or on-demand (ISR)
   - Dynamic content is served via API routes
