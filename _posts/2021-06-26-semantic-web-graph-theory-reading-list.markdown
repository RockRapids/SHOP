# Introduction

The most interesting, and actually more likely to prove generally useful, parts of graph theory probably do not start with the the cookbook quickie recipes for representations but are about how the constructs came to be or the stories behind the HISTORY of graph theory ... in all things, it's important to understand the process of knowledge development and how the concept came to be recognized.

In the history of mathematics, [Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) solution of the Königsberg seven bridges problem is considered to be the first theorem of [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), and represented the first true proof in the theory of networks, a subject now generally regarded as a branch of [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics). Euler's formula relating the number of edges, vertices, and faces of a convex polyhedron was studied and generalized by [Cauchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy) and [L'Huilier]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Antoine_Jean_L%27Huilier, and set the stage for the ideas leading to the branch of mathematics known as [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology).

Of course, topics like [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics) or [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology) now represent deep, deep lakes or oceans of knowledge, full of many important constructs, each worthy of hours and days if not years of contemplation.  For example, we might consider the paths and connections which lead us to different humans beings and we realize that in the seemingly infinite population of hundreds of millions or even billions of humans there are actually very few, maybe only six, degrees of separation of any one of us from any other one of us ... when we consider the friends of friends of friends of friends of friends of friends, there are very few humans we will be unconnected to ... that will be true in whether we are talking about artists, scientists, celebrities or violent criminals.  This was illustrated by Stanley Milgram's [small-world experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_experiment) which actually comprised a program of several experiments conducted by Milgram and other researchers examining the [average path length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_path_length) for 1960s-era social networks of people in the United States. The research was groundbreaking in that it suggested that human society will tend to form paths between a small-world-type networks which end up making things like communicable diseases or exchanges of information characterized by really short path-lengths [before the internet existed, when a long-distance phone call was a big deal and or things like air travel or even the completed interstate highway system were commonly used]. ***Information, including the information found in virus DNA [from any one of the 400,000 zoonotic viruses which attack mammals like humans], WILL ALWAYS find its ways to be free.***
